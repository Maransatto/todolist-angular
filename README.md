# My Todo List

This is a project intended to show a bit of a state management.

Though I haven't used NgRx, I created the structure of an unidirectional data flow, abstracting the layers into **Presentation Layer**, **Abstraction Layer** and **Core Layer**.

Here is an article from where I learned it before and used it in some real projects:

## How to test it

1. You should first run `npm install` so that all the dependencies will be installed.

2. You will be able to create a sort of temporary users and they are stored only in a state memory. If you refresh the page, all of the users will be lost. 

3. After creating a user, go to signin page and sign in.

4. After logged in, you will see a todo list and will be able to create new tasks, filter them by name and status, complete tasks to be done, undo the completition or remove the completed ones.

> Take a note: I forced some random erros so that you can have the experience of facing them from a REST API.
